/home/michael/.config/Ultralytics/settings.yaml

Within settings file, set these folders:

datasets_dir: /home/michael/Ultralytics/Datasets
weights_dir: /home/michael/Ultralytics/Weights
runs_dir: /home/michael/Ultralytics/Runs

Download from Roboflow and put into /home/michael/Ultralytics/Datasets

'sudo apt install lzma-dev' 'sudo apt install liblzma-dev' before compiling python
so those are included when compiling because ultralytics uses 'from _lzma import *'

1. Prerequisite

sudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall
sudo apt-get install libreadline-gplv2-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev tk-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev libbz2-dev libffi-dev zlib1g-dev

2. Download Python source

Go to all downloads page and download the XZ compressed source tarball
Check MD5
Extract to /home/michael/Misc/Python-3.8.1

3. Compile

CD to /home/michael/Misc/Python-3.8.1
sudo ./configure --enable-optimizations
sudo make altinstall

Executables are in /usr/local/bin/

make altinstall is used to prevent replacing the default python binary file /usr/bin/python


4. Virtual Environment

Create virtual environments based on the clean install. Don't install libs into the clean install. 

Added requirements.txt
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Make virtual env like this:

cd /home/michael/VirtualEnvironments
python3.11 -m venv Vinyl

python3.11 is the new version in /usr/local/bin/ - check with 'which python3.11'

Then install requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt
